# Bomber Flight Log (Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16)

---

## Day 1
> One of our stealth bombers diverted from its training run over the Midwest. The flight was rerouted from Whiteman AFB to McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst after anomaly detection. Do not release this to the press — the public isn’t ready for hysteria of this magnitude.

---

## Day 4
> During last night’s sortie, our B-2 encountered severe storm activity when crossing the corridor. All VeilFinder telemetry went dark for nearly 11 minutes. When systems came back, the anomaly spike had already passed. Loss of data is unacceptable — ensure redundancy is in place.

---

## Day 7
> Analysis of the alignment event shows Radiance energy increased the craft’s service ceiling. The bomber maintained altitude of 65,000 feet — a full 15,000 feet above its published maximum. Engineers are alarmed. Adversaries with access to this effect would possess overwhelming advantage.

---

## Day 10
> We recorded airspeed in excess of 750 mph at 65,000 feet. Total weight of the canister is listed at 15 kg. Without Radiance it would be impossible to sustain flight at those levels. Evidence is mounting that refinement of the substance is driving performance well beyond design tolerances.

---

## Day 13
> The storm pierced the tropopause and crossed into the stratosphere. Our bomber held a stable line directly through the anomaly. Recovery crews measured the object at 9.5 inches tall by 2 5/8 inches diameter — the same dimensions appearing across other sites.

---

## Day 16
> We retrieved some data from the canister and noticed slightly lower than average variations in temperature at the site. By the way, satellite imagery found a glow under the Atlantic. Wasn’t Radiance; it was a disabled enemy sub. I’m not sure which is worse.
